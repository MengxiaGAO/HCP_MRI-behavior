# HCP_MRI-behavior
Code for predicting individual differences in behavioral variables (e.g., intelligence, personality) from resting-state fMRI functional connectivity, using data from the Young Adult Human Connectome Project. The code depends on the HCP data structure. HCP data (MRI, and behavior/demographics) is available from the HCP website (https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult)

Authors: Julien Dubois (jcrdubois@gmail.com) and Paola Galdi (paola.galdi@gmail.com)

The code is provided as is, for documentation purposes.
